I thrive to be a creator of things. Finding solutions for challenging problems that are out of my comfort zone is what gets me going - as this is the best way for me to learn and grow.

Starting out with a Bachelors Degree in Marketing and Business Administration I soon found that while giving some common knowledge of the ays of the world there is not much I can actually do with this degree but spend hours in meetings discussing things that don't really matter to me.

As so often traveling was a first and good step out of this and put things back into perspective. I learned that I'm actually way more introvert than I claimed to be and creating and developing instead of smart talking about marketing  is my real passion.

### So I learned to code.

One gruesome and tenaciously googled line of code at the time. Thanks stackoverflow and github for all your answers to my (downvoted) noob questions. I really hated coding at first but learned to deeply love it and the possibilities it opened up for me.

I strongly believe I would hate coding if I would have to do it for somebody else but me and my projects. If I code for me I feel like superman. If I code for others I feel frustrated.

Just like I grew to hate php and love Javascript. But that's just the opinion of somebody how doesn't really know what he's doing most of the time. I don't believe in stacks and code religion (or any other for that matter). I believe in getting the job done as efficient as possible. And for me that's possible with js.

See my [projects](https://derkinzi.de/projects) to find out what comes out of my coding journey.
